## Final Insight and Findings

### 1. Project Recap
   **This project aimed to build a predictive model using logistic regresion to identify customers likely to churn based on demogrphic, financial and behaviorial data. By analyzing patterns in customer attributes, we sought to provide insights that can help banks develop proactive retention strategies.**

### 2. Key Findings from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   **a. Customers from France and Germany had higher churn rates**
   
   **b. Middle-aged customers (40-50 years) shows higher churn compared to younger customers.**
   
   **c. Customers with fewer products were more likely to churn.**
   
   **d. There is no strong correlation between credit score and churn, indicating it is not a primary factor.**
   
### 3. Model Performance and Evaluation
**a. Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 81%, indicating how well it classifies churn vs. non churn customers.**

**b. Precision & Recall: Precision was 63%, and recall was 18%, highlighting how effectively the model identifies true churn cases.**

### 4. Business Recommendations
**a. Customer Retention Programs: Focus on retaining middle-aged customers by offfering targeted incentives**

**b. Product Cross- Selling: Encourage customers with fewer products to explore more financial services to increase engagement.**

**c. Account Balance Monitoring: Identify customers with extreme account balance and provide tailored financial advice.**

### 5. Limitations & Future Improvements 
**a. The model was limited to logistic regression;other models like Random Forest or Neural Networks which takes account of the data non linearity and less correlation of features could improve accuracy**

**b. Feature engineering could be enhanced by incorporating more customer behaviour metrics.**

**c. The dataset did not include customer feedback or reason for churn, which could provide deeper insight.**

### 6. Conclusion
**This project successfully built a logistic regression model to predict customer churn with reasonable accuracy. The insight gained can help financial institutions proactively address churn risks and improve customer retention. Future work can focus on enhancing predictive power using advanced machine learning techniques and integrating additional customer interaction data.**
